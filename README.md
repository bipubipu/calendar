It took me a long way to solve this particular problem.  
Didn't know there is method which returns the day of the week. I even wrote one by myself. Accordingly I also wrote a piece about checking if a year is leap year.    
Though I took extra time on that, it's still worth it.  
This project is also not a perfect one. There's so much I can do about it, like changing the interaction and adding more styles, more features.
But I'm glad that I know how to use JS to manipulate DOM now, which is an achievement for me. ðŸŒ¼
